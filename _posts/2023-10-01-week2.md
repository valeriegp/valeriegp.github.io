This week I have continued to work on scene development and I got far enough to where I was also able to start working with lighting.  I am finding that the lighting options are quite limiting, especially when compared to other 3D/motion graphics software.  I have also realized that in order for the scene to feel more convincingly immersive, that I need to surround my scene within a dome.  I will likely be using Blender to create this dome.

In looking through my syllabus from my Autism Across the Lifespan (AAL) special topics course, I also realized that there are several assignments that I can directly tie into my DREAM project.  One of them is a community engagement assignment, which I will use as an opportunity to interview persons that could share some insight on more varied specifics of the airport related anxieties that autistic persons have.  This could be caretakers, therapists, or autistic individuals.  I have created a preliminary flier to begin to engage interest.
