With the IRB clarifications addressed and the application resubmitted, I turned my attention towards actively tackling the character design of my NPCs. I am actually toying with the idea of creating characters that resemble dollhouse dolls. In my research I have learned that attempting to achieve reality is not necessary, and is often less effective, even within immersive simulations. I still want to create a believable/consistent scenario, however, and have noted that actual dollhouses look real and the dolls used within them do not. I felt further confident in this appraoch when looking at the popular game (among children and adults) called Animal Crossings, which has very simplified doll-like character design. Finally, a simplified character design approach has a much more practical time-saving benefit as far as production. I went ahead and laid out various facial expressions, hairstyles, colors, etc. that could be combined with 2 base character designs.  Meaning, I have 2 doll bodies that can wear various facial expressions, hairstyles, colors, etc. to create a divers population of NPCs.
