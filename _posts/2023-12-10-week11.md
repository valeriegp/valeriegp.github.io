title: Week 11

I had a 3rd round of IRB Clarification Requests this week, which I was able to quickly address and my IRB was subsequently accepted! The IRB Application was accepted during the last week of classes, however, so I will be waiting until the start of the Spring semester to begin this study. This means that I will not be able to actually engage in this study for the DREAM portion of this project. Due to a final paper assignment in my Autism across the Lifespan course, which I was able to cater to apply to this project directly, I also decided to write a first draft of the technical paper for the M4 DREAM requirements as this final paper assignment. This is what I spent this past week doing and I am quite pleased with the draft of this paper. What I have left to do is to change it from a project proposal style to a technical paper format, which will include more project details. Having Professor Eileen Crehan review and grade this paper also has the added benefit of having a professional collaborator on autism research look over my work so far.  

Due to a delay at the beginning of this semester with being able to begin my DREAM research (due to a family related health emergency), I have an extension on submitting my M4 DREAM requiremnts. This means that I will be spending a good portion of my winter break on finalizing the paper that I described and advancing _CYO Airport Story_ as much as possible.
