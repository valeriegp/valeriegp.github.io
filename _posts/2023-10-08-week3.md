I am happy to report that I have wrapped up this phase of scene development for the ticketing area, including the immersive dome. Aside from likely needing to add some overlooked details, such as benches, the ticketing area scene is looking pretty complete. This is good timing, since my advisor suggested that I fill out an IRB application at Tufts in order to be able to include the community engagement interviews (mentioned in last weeks post) in my research paper. This is why I have also begun working through the required training that is needed when submitting an IRB application.

Having essentially completed the ticketing scene, I am beginning to more actively consider how the interface will function, specifically when users approach certain areas or persons. I had some ideas of using pop up windows, though this couldnâ€™t solve every scenario, such as the more involved Kiosk interaction. I decided to spend some time looking at games that involve tasks to see how others have dealt with this situation. The game Sneaky Sasquatch was especially helpful, since the character walks around making decisions and also needs to interact with an ATM, for example.
