I received a 2nd round of IRB Clarification Requests, which mainly focus on fully clarifying exactly how I will recruit and what the level of involvment of my Autism Across the Lifespan professor, Eileen Crehan (who has also served as kind of an unofficial secondary advisor on this project), is. In order to address both of these issues, since the clarificaitons had to do more specifically with Eileen using her [Crehan Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/crehanlab/) records as a form of recruitment.
