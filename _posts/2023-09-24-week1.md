title: Week 1

I decided to sign up for a special topics course this semester, which should actively support this project, entitled Autism Across the Lifespan. The professor who teaches this course works in the department of Child Study and Human Development at Tufts and is also an active collaborator of my DREAM advisor. Through this collaboration, she has experience working with CS students and had already offered useful insight over the summer, before I decided to sign up for her course.

While becoming more familiar with the community that my current project intends to serve, which is now much more well guided through the above mentioned course, I am also working through developing my first scene of the project.  I have decided to start with the ticketing area and am focusing on setting the space, objects, and textures up properly. While there aren't many details to report here, I am finding it to be quite time-consuming. 

I had to miss around 2.5 weeks of active work towards this project, due to a family related medical emergency, which is why there is a 3 week gap since my last post.  I also decided to separate my summer posts from my semester posts, so I have labeled all previous posts as summer weeks.
