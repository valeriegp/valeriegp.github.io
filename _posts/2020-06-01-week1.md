title: Weeks 1 and 2
---

I will be putting in 10 hours a week during the summer, which means that my summer posts will include 2 weeks each, in order to sum up 20 hours. I will also be meeting in person with my advisor, Professor Fahad Dogar, bi-weekly.  

I began this research project with the broad concept of creating a VR experience that could help autistic individuals prepare for going to the airport. I began my research by reading papers by a recent Tufts PhD Computer Science graduate, Tooba Ahsen, whose work focused on the use of AR for autistic contexts. My advisor served as Tooba's advisor during their time at Tufts, and it was his suggestion that I begin my research in this manner.  I also looked through Tooba's references and began collecting relevant articles for my own project, which I began to organize within a google doc with links.

We decided that this project should be created in Unity, so I made sure to get Unity setup and running on my personal computer. The plan is to spend the summer doing mostly reading and going through Unity tutorials in order to get a better idea of what can actually be accomplished with this tool.
