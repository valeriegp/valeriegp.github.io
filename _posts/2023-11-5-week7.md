title: Week 7

I was able to return to production this week and, unfortunately, immediately ran into a bug that slowed things down. I had left off with a completed ticketing/bag drop area scene, which included window views and barriers set up so that the user cannot move outside of the scene. When I attempted to run the simulation again, I was getting a blank view. I discovered that this came from accidentally importing a second camera into Unity from Blender when creating the dome that encapsulates the scene. Once this was debugged, I decided to lay out my remaining tasks and to schedule my remaining weeks for the DREAM phase of this project (I will be continuing this project next semester through a Masters Project class at Tufts).

My remaining tasks are...

-design characters

-set up social story and ticketing area as scenes

-link OpenAI with social story scene

-add a Non Player Character (NPC)

-finalize character design and rig characters

-finalize kiosk interaction

-add more NPCs

-finalize website and technical paper for DREAM M4 requirements

In order to tackle these tasks, I decided to start out be doing research involving immersion vs realism, in order to better inform my character design. I also spent time learning how to incorporate Open AI with Unity. I learned that I could use AI with each NPC, essentially giving them each their own personality and without having to manually narrate anticipated interactions.
