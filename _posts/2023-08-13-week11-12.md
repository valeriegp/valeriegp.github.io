title: Summer Weeks 11 and 12
--- 

Having arrived at a point where the project became more focused, I felt it necessary to put some time into synthesizing the research that I had done up to this point. These past couple of weeks, I spent some time organizing the articles that I had read and made note of the type of research that I still need to explore. I used the remainder of my time working through Unity tutorials that felt relevant to this project. I do feel that I am finished simply working through tutorials at this point, however, and will be moving towards more actively producing *CYO Airport Story* in the next couple of weeks.
