## About Me

Valerie Guinn Polgar is a master's student in the Department of Computer Science at Tufts. She holds a BFA in Digital Art from George Mason University and an MFA in Computer Art from the School of Visual Arts. Valerie spent over a decade as an active practicing artist and educator. She has worked with video, animation, coding, and physical computing in order to create both screen based and interactive immersive installations intended to foster growth, collaboration, and connection. She also founded and directed a media arts entity called Misbits NMA in Oxford, MS from 2016-2020 and has served as head programmer of experimental film and animation for the Oxford Film Festival since 2017. Valerie is currently transitioning into the field of computer science because she is interested in creating games and tools for healthcare and accessibility purposes.

## About My Advisor

Fahad Dogar is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science department at Tufts University. He completed his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University and his B.Sc. from LUMS, Pakistan. Before joining Tufts, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the systems and networking group at Microsoft Research UK. Dogar's research interests span the broad areas of networking and distributed systems, with a recent focus on data center networking and future Internet architectures. He is also interested in designing technologies for developing regions and for autistic contexts. His research has been published in venues like ACM SIGCOMM, Usenix NSDI, and ACM MobiCom. His awards include a gold medal from the president of Pakistan for being the top computer science student in his undergraduate cohort.

## About My Project

The design and development of a real game VR experience intended for autistic individuals as a therapy tool to practice scenarios that are not routine and that can cause stress and anxiety.  Special attention is being given to identifying methods of bridging therapy and game practices into a cohesive experience.

The scenario of visiting the airport has been chosen as the focus for this project, as it involves several areas of potential focus such as waiting in line, going through security, getting tickets, etc.  The game aspect of this project will be based on a "choose your own adventure" experience where clear goals and rewards are built into the experience. The use of a communly used therapeutic practice of social stories, for autistic individuals, will be incorporated into the design of this project.

Primary areas of focus involve finding sustainable methods of customization, which is essential when designing technologies for the autistic community, tracking/monitoring engagement and progress in order to be able to eventaully assess the overall effectiveness of this project, and designing for the potential of longer term engagement of users through gamification and aesthetics.  The use of AI will be explored in order to aid in the successful implementation of the first two areas of focus.
