## About Me

Valerie Guinn Polgar is a master's student in the Department of Computer Science at Tufts, with an expected graduation date of 2025. She holds a BFA in Digital Art from George Mason University and an MFA in Computer Art from the School of Visual Arts. Valerie spent over a decade as an active practicing artist and educator. She has worked with video, animation, coding, and physical computing in order to create both screen based and interactive immersive installations intended to foster growth, collaboration, and connection. Valerie has taught at Lincroft Community College in New Jersey, Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond VA, and at the University of Mississippi in various Art and Computer related departments. She also founded and directed a media arts entity called Misbits NMA in Oxford, MS from 2016-2020 and has served as head programmer of experimental film and animation for the Oxford Film Festival since 2017. Valerie is currently transitioning into the field of computer science because she is interested in creating games and tools for healthcare and accessibility purposes. She recently completed her Post-Baccalaureate in Computer Science at Tufts in 2023.

## About My Advisor

<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fahaddogar/home" target="_blank">Fahad Dogar</a> is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at Tufts University. He completed his Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University and his B.Sc. from LUMS, Pakistan. Before joining Tufts, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the systems and networking group at Microsoft Research UK. Dogar's research interests span the broad areas of networking and distributed systems, with a recent focus on data center networking and future Internet architectures. He is also interested in designing technologies for developing regions and for autistic contexts. His research has been published in venues like ACM SIGCOMM, Usenix NSDI, and ACM MobiCom. His awards include a gold medal from the president of Pakistan for being the top computer science student in his undergraduate cohort.

## About My Project

Autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is a developmental disorder that can affect the way that people learn, communicate, and interact. There is not one generalized approach to successfully working with individuals with autism, which is why it is so important for family members, care takers, and teachers to have the ability to personalize learning tools and methods. *CYOAirport Story* is a serious game VR experience intended as a therapy tool to facilitate practicing going to the airport, which is not a routine or easily practiced scenario that can cause an especially high degree of stress and anxiety amongst autistic individuals.

The scenario of visiting the airport has been chosen as the focus for this project because it involves several areas of interest, such as moving through crowds, waiting in line, and dealing with unexpected social interactions or changes of plan. These areas of interest will be explored through different places or scenes, such as the security line and the ticketing area. Social Stories, created by Carol Gray in 1990, are a commonly used and effective practice designed for autistic individuals and their families. They will be incorporated into this project as a prelude to each of the available airport scenes. The available Social Stories will also include the option to personalize relevant themes for the intended user before they engage with *CYOAirport Story*. The game aspect of this project will be based on a “choose your own adventure” experience with clear goals and rewards.

Social Stories were specifically developed as a method of helping autistic individuals to better understand specific events, interactions, customs, etc. that are known to cause fear, stress, confusion, or anxiety. The idea is that by becoming familiar with one of these stories, an individual will be better prepared to face the subjects presented in these stories in real life. By presenting these stories before a specific airport scenario within *CYOAirport Story*, an individual should feel better prepared to engage with our airport simulation. The use of VR was chosen in order to create the opportunity to practice going to an airport in a more accessible and cost efficient manner and the serious game aspect of this project is intended to make the experience more engaging and to further eliminate potential anxiety or stress.

The primary areas of focus during the development of this project will be in finding extensive and efficient methods of customization (which is an essential feature when designing technologies for the autistic community specifically), tracking/monitoring engagement and progress in order to be able to eventually assess the overall effectiveness of this project, and designing for longer term engagement of users through gamification and aesthetics.  The use of AI, in order to improve customization options for this project, is being especially considered.
